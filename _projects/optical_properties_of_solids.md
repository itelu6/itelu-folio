Here is the outline when I studied the book, "Optical Properties of Solids" written by Fox<d-cite key="fox2002optical"></d-cite>. 

## What are the main optical physics in solids? 
Here we introduce the three general optical processes in solids: reflection, propagation, and transmission, and primarily focus on the optical physics occuring in the propagation stage.  

### outline

* **What and why to learn**: to understand what kind of optical physics occur in solids, what are the main materials, and what tools we have to explain the optical properties.  

* **What are the main phenomena occuring in propagation?** refraction, absorption, luminescence, and scattering

* **How should we quantify the optical properties of materials?** optical coefficients such as reflectivity, transmissivity, absorption (Beer's law), optical density, Stoke shift, or scattering corss sections.

* **What is the relationship between the complex refraction index and the complex dielectric constants?** 

* **What kind of optical materials do we have and what are their main features?** metals, crystalline insulators and semiconductors, glass, doped glasses and insulators, and molecular materials. 

* **What are the main optical physics of solids that differ from atoms or molecule physics?** Crystal symmetry (Neumann's principle), electronic bands, vibronic bands, density of states, and delocalized states (excitons) and collective excitations (plasma). 

* **What are the main models that we use to explain the optical properties?** classical (medium and light), semiclassical (atoms and light), and fully quantum (atoms and photons).
