Here I update my research exploration (mainly physics, specifically, condensed matter physics), readings (productivity, habits, and all sorts of my personal interests), and my personal on-going testing-the-water projects.

I am an ordinary physicist and engineer. Acoording to Landau's genius scale that he invented to rank physicists around the world, I probably would be categorized into the 5.0 group (Mundane or "pathologists"); no matter what, I just enjoy it! 

Though my major is in materials science and engineering (minor in physics), I like to involve myself in a multidisciplinary research environment that covers a wide spectrum of research work such as physics, chemistry, biology and so on, though my research main focus is on developing computational methods for exploring solid states materials or condensed matters. 

My personal goal is to be a good scientist, tech entrepreneur, and inspiring educator to help the next generation : ) In my personal life, I am also a Yogi, who practices meditation every day to understand myself and to find the connection betweem myself and the universe.
