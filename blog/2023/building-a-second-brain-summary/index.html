I would like to have a systematic way to organize my notes on a wide range of topics tha I am interested in.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>I-Te (young self) 👦</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="my-response-to-the-email">My response to the email</h1> <h2 id="the-book-i-read-building-a-second-brain">The book I read “building a second brain”</h2> <p>The system I use for organizing my personal (digital) notes or project information is called “a second brain”, which I have set up when I read the book “<em>Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential</em>” by <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tiago Forte</a>. I would highly recommend you to read the book to get your own experience. However, in the following I would summarize what I have learned from that book. Alternatively, you could also use the keywords “second brain”, “note taking”, and so on on Youtube and Google to learn from others’ experience and introduction to the method.</p> <h2 id="the-purpose-of-the-second-brain">The purpose of the second brain</h2> <p>For me, the purpose of the second brain is not to have a perfect system to collect and organize all the notes, but is to have the material ready when I start to create (and then share) something such as a piece of research work, manuscript, or codes.</p> <blockquote> <p>Most important of all, don’t get caught in the trap of perfectionism</p> </blockquote> <p>The second brain is there to help us think deeperly and produce more useful information instead of consuming. As the author of the book suggests:</p> <blockquote> <p>I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="set-up-a-second-brain">Set up a second brain</h2> <p>To set up a second brain, we need two things: 1) a container system to collect notes, called <a href="#para-the-container-to-put-notes">PARA</a>; 2) a set of principles to deal with those notes, called <a href="#code-the-principles-to-deal-with-notes">CODE</a>.</p> <h3 id="para-the-container-to-put-notes">PARA: the container to put notes</h3> <p>The container system is called <strong>PARA</strong>, which stands for:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>P</strong>rojects(what I’m Working on right now): a specific and clear goal or outcome that needs to achieve</li> <li> <strong>A</strong>reas (what I’m committed to over time): there is a standard (not a specific goal to reach) that I want to uphold in each of these areas such as finance or health</li> <li> <strong>R</strong>esources (things I want to reference in the future): any topic I am interested in gathering information about such as quantum physics or investment</li> <li> <strong>A</strong>rchives (things I’ve completed or put on hold)</li> </ul> <p>PARA can be used across a wide range of platforms where we store information and notes. For example, I have PARA systems set up on my Mac laptop, Chrome (bookmark), OneNote (electronic notebooks) and Zotero (a reference management software).</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/itelu-folio/assets/img/BSB-mypara-demo.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> My PARA systems set up across different platforms. </div> <p>In additional to PARA, I personally also include a directory called “Inbox” to put any notes when I capture those notes at the first time. The first moment we capture an idea is the worst time to decide what it means and where it should go, so let’s put it into the so-called inbox and organize the note later using the CODE principles.</p> <h3 id="code-the-principles-to-deal-with-notes">CODE: the principles to deal with notes</h3> <p>The principles to organize notes is called <strong>CODE</strong> and the key concepts for each principle can be condensed into the following:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="#capture-keep-what-resonates"><strong>C</strong>apture</a>: Keep What Resonates</li> <li> <a href="#organize-save-for-actionability"><strong>O</strong>rganize</a>: Save for Actionability</li> <li> <a href="#distill-find-the-essence"><strong>D</strong>istill</a>: Find the Essence</li> <li> <a href="#express-show-your-work"><strong>E</strong>xpress</a>: Show Your Work</li> </ul> <h4 id="capture-keep-what-resonates">Capture: Keep What Resonates</h4> <p>The author of the book suggests us a method called “<a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/12-favorite-problems-how-to-spark-genius-with-the-power-of-open-questions/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Twelve favorite problems</a>” invented by a well-known physicist, Richard Feynman, to capture the information that resonates with us; the number of problems is not the main point here but gives us the starting points for what to collect.</p> <p>Ask oursevles: <strong>“what are the questions I’ve always been interested in?”</strong>. For example, some of questions that I am interested in include “How could we become very productive and learn many things quickly?”, “How does emergence work? Is there any underlying theory?”, “What is the source that the universe is accelerating?”, and so on. Once I have a clear picture on what I am interested in, I am more conscious to capture ideas from all kind of sources.</p> <p>There are four criteria proposed by the author of the book: 1) does it inspire me? 2) is it useful? 3) is it personal? 4) Is it surprising? When we read information, we could ask the above questions, and start to snapshot or capture those portions of information that resonates with us. Ideally, “no more than 10 percent of the original source, at most” suggested by the author.</p> <p>Those notes we capture should be put into the inbox; later, when we start to work on the notes, we will have a second chance to take a look at the notes, and decide where we should still keep it and then move them into our PARA systems.</p> <h4 id="organize-save-for-actionability">Organize: Save for Actionability</h4> <p>For each note in the inbox, we have to find a place of PARA for it. Aks ourselve: “<strong>How is this (note) going to help me move forward one of my current projects?</strong>”. We start at the top of PARA and moving down: In which project will this be most useful? \(\rightarrow\) No, then, in which area will this be most useful? \(\rightarrow\) No, then, which resource does this belong to? \(\rightarrow\) No, then, place in archives.</p> <p>In the projects directory, I usually have a few ongoing projects, and basically, I put all the relevant notes into the corresponding projects (for example, plese see the picture below). The number of notes for each project varies, e.g., in some projects, I have around 30+ notes, while for some, I have around 10+ nodes. Similarly, for the other PARA directories.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/itelu-folio/assets/img/BSB-project-demo.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A few of my projects in the projects directory of my PARA system in my electronic notebooks. </div> <h4 id="distill-find-the-essence">Distill: Find the Essence</h4> <p>The purpose for distilling the notes is to save time for our future selves. Ask ourselves: “<strong>How can I make this (note) as useful as possible for my future self?</strong>”. Think of ourselves not just as a taker of notes, but as a giver of notes to our future selves.</p> <p>The author of the book suggests us to a method called “progressive summarization” to get the essence of the information. The method works like this: from a raw note (1st layer) to a highlighted note (2nd and 3rd layer) then to a summary note (executive summary with a few bullet points in our own words).</p> <p>For example, for preparing this article for building a second brain, when I read the book, I highlighted all the contents that resonant with me, and exported the highlighted texts into my “05_Inbox” in my OneNote. Next time (one week later) I reviewed the raw notes (1st layer), and then highlighted some of the texts in bold (2nd layer). After another one week, I reviewed and distilled down or highlighted the texts in the 2nd layer, which becomes my 3rd layer. Finally, one week after, with all the 2nd and 3rd layer highlighted texts at hand, I copied and pasted them into a blank page, and started to work on this article; notice that I do not work on anything from scratch, but with some distilled information at hand. This article is my executive summary for the book I read. One does not have to create a long executive summary like this; instead, a short summary with bullet points is good enough to serve as an executive summary for our future selves.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/itelu-folio/assets/img/BSB-progressive-summary-demo.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> An example for the progressive summarization method when I prepared this article for the book. </div> <blockquote> <p>Progressive Summarization is not a method for remembering as much as possible—it is a method for forgetting as much as possible. (In the book, there is a good story on how Picasso worked on his art)</p> </blockquote> <p>A few mistakes to avoid at this stage:</p> <ul> <li>over-highlighting: each layer of highlighting should contain less than 10–20 percent of the previous layer.</li> <li>highlighting without a purpose in mind: we should do it when we are ready to create something using the note.</li> </ul> <h4 id="express-show-your-work">Express: Show Your Work</h4> <p>Here comes to the main purpose of the second brain: to create the knowledge assets. The knowledge assets can be measured in terms of the so-called intermediate packets (IPs), in additional to the final products. Five kinds of IPs we can create and reuse in our work are distilled notes, outtakes, work-in-process, final deliverables, and documents created by others. Ask ourselves the following questions: “<strong>What are the knowledge assets you’re creating today that will be most reusable in the future?What are the building blocks that will move forward your projects tomorrow?</strong>” For example, my 1st, 2nd and 3rd layer notes (shown in the previous section) or the executive summary for this article.</p> <p>After I learn this principle from the book, now everyday when I start working on my research projects, I always ask myself the following question: <em>what is the intermediate packet I can produce/provide after today’s work or research exploration?</em> For example, when reading a scientific paper, my IP is usually a short summary on the paper, where I list a few bullet points for the key concepts or what I need to know (what resonate with me); For working on formula derivation, I usually end up an IP, which can be a derivation note or a summary of a few insights during the derivation; when implementing a few equations in an open source code, my IP is the git log or commit to show what I have done; for writing a manuscript, my IP can be an outline, a section, or a few paragraphs for describing a concept.</p> <p>The most important step after I finish my IP is to inform my colleagues of what I have done in the project or to send out the IP to my colleagues for a quick feedback.</p> <blockquote> <p>Reframing your productivity in terms of Intermediate Packets (IPs) is a major step toward this turning point. It’s about taking ownership of your work, your ideas, and your potential to contribute in whatever arena you find yourself in.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="tips-for-working-on-a-project">Tips for working on a project</h2> <p>When we work on a project, the process can be roughly categorized into two modes: divergence and convergence. The two modes are not a linear path but a loop. In the divergence mode, we open and explore every possible option, searching online and jumping from one to another page, capturing all sorts of the relevant notes. On the other mode, convergence mode, we turn off all the distractions including searching more information, and trust our notes and create the intermediate products or the final product toward completion.</p> <p>The temptation for searching more information for our project, when we decide to work in the convergence mode, seem to be forward progress and productive; however, it in fact postpones the moment of completion. When working in the convergence mode, we should pay attention to that temptation. One way I find useful to overcome the temptation is to simply write down what to search into another sticky note, which sends a signal to my brain that I will do it later once I am working in the divergence mode but not now.</p> <blockquote> <p>Overcome the fear of missing out. Note that we are not completing the whole project at one sitting; our aim is to complete the small intermediate packet.</p> </blockquote> <p>The author of the book suggests three methods for us when we work in the convergence mode:</p> <ol> <li>the Archipelago of Ideas (give ourselves stepping-stones): I usually put all the related notes on a blank page and start with those notes, so not from the scratch.</li> <li>the Hemingway Bridge (use yesterday’s momentum today): “Stop when you are going good” suggested by Hemingway. What I usally do is to write down the current status, any details we have in mind, and the intention for the next work session.</li> <li>Dial down the scope (ship something small and concrete): ask ourselves “What is the smallest version of this I can produce to get useful feedback from others?”</li> </ol> <h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2> <p>Above I have mentioned the key ideas of building up a second brain via the PARA system and the CODE principles. I wish you enjoy building your second brain and exploring the system by yourselve. I believe that, after experiencing how to deal with notes via the second brain system, you will become more confident and successful in swimming in the overwhelming information sea, and start to work on your projects with the intermediate packets in mind.</p> <p>P.S. If you are interested in more details on how to set up a second brain, please refer to the book that I mentioned at the beginning. Here I do not mention a few sections in the book inclduing the relevant habits for maintaining the second brain and how to reflect on the system and the notes.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 I-Te Lu.
